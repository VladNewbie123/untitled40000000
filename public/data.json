"description":"<b>2007 Audie Award Winner for Non-Fiction, Abridged<\/b><br /><br />Even before the Beatles hit the big time, a myth was created. This version of the Beatles legend smoothed the rough edges and filled in the fault lines, and for more than forty years this manicured version of the Beatles story has sustained as truth -- until now.<br /> The product of almost a decade of research, hundreds of unprecedented interviews, and the discovery of scores of never-before-revealed documents, Bob Spitz's <i>The Beatles<\/i> is the biography fans have been waiting for.<br /> Never before has a biography of musicians been so immersive and textured. We are there in the McCartney living room when Paul and John learn to write songs together; backstage the night Ringo takes over on drums; in seedy German strip clubs where George lies about his age so the band can perform; and at the <i>Ed Sullivan Show<\/i> as America discovers the joy and the madness. From Shea to San Francisco, through the London night, on to India, through marmalade skies, across the universe-all the way to a rooftop concert and one last moment of laughter and music.<br /> It is all here, the highs and the lows, the love and the rivalry, the drugs, the tears, the thrill, the magic never again to be repeated. Bob Spitz's masterpiece is, at long last, the biography the Beatles deserve."},

"description":"<i>The Beatles: Image and the Media<\/i> charts the transformation of the Beatles from teen idols to leaders of the youth movement and powerful cultural agents. Drawing upon American mainstream print media, broadcasts, albums, films, and videos, the study covers the band's career in the United States. Michael R. Frontani explores how the Beatles' media image evolved and how this transformation related to cultural and historical events. <br /><br />Upon their arrival in the U.S., the Beatles wore sharply tailored suits and cast themselves as adorable, accessible teen heartthrobs. By the end of the decade, they had absorbed the fashion and consciousness of the burgeoning counterculture and were using their interviews, media events, and music to comment on issues such as the Vietnam War, drug culture, and civil rights. Frontani traces the steps that led to this change and comments on how the band's mantra of essential optimism never wavered despite the evolution of its media profile. The book is published by University Press of Mississippi. <br /><br />Michael R. Frontani is associate professor of communications at Elon University. His work has appeared in <i>American Journalism<\/i>, <i>Journal of American Culture<\/i>, <i>Journalism History<\/i>, and <i>African Studies Review<\/i>."},

"description":"January 1970: the Beatles assemble one more time to put the finishing touches on Let It Be; Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young are wrapping up DejA Vu; Simon and Garfunkel are unveiling Bridge Over Troubled Water; James Taylor is an upstart singer-songwriter who's just completed Sweet Baby James. Over the course of the next twelve months, their lives-and the world around them-will change irrevocably.<br />Fire and Rain tells the story of four iconic albums of 1970 and the lives, times, and constantly intertwining personal ties of the remarkable artists who made them. Acclaimed journalist David Browne sets these stories against an increasingly chaotic backdrop of events that sent the world spinning throughout that tumultuous year: Kent State, the Apollo 13 debacle, ongoing bombings by radical left-wing groups, the diffusion of the antiwar movement, and much more.<br />Featuring candid interviews with more than one hundred luminaries, including some of the artists themselves, Browne's vivid narrative tells the incredible story of how-over the course of twelve turbulent months-the '60s effectively ended and the '70s began."},

"description":"In 1968, the Beatles trekked to a remote, mysterious, and beautiful part of India known as Rishikesh, or the valley of the saints. For literally thousands of years, this remote riverside valley has been a magnet for advanced yogis, mystics, and seekers of truth. In 1968, it was the absolute zenith of all of this and the pop world as well. It was here the Beatles wrote dozens of now iconic songs while meditating at the feet of the lauded spiritual master. Along with many of the world's most celebrated people, the group once again led the way as innovators in not only music, but innate spirituality as well. Fifty years later, we remember the group's bold trek and artistic accomplishment in this inspirational audio biography from Beatles author and historian Geoffrey Giuliano. The Maharishi, the Beatles, and friends tell their own story in this one-of-a-kind celebration of a magical time gone by. If you are a fan of the Beatles and love their music, you have to have this extended, in-depth look at the birth of The Beatles' White Album. In 1992 Geoffrey Giuliano was asked if he would do an exclusive interview with the Maharishi in Switzerland. The author readily agreed as the reclusive spiritual master almost never met the press and he was embarking on an ambitious program of mass meditation to try to purify vast areas of the United States. After a great deal of negotiation, the two finally got together on Christmas Eve and had a prolonged, stirring conversation that is documented here. In addition, the Maharishi was joined by the late world-class magician Doug Henning. Put together with a chronological, historical narration by Giuliano, here is your chance to go one on one with one of the greatest spiritual minds of our time. This is the complete, exhaustive, untold story of the Beatles and the Maharishi, circa 1968."},

"longDescription":"In 1962 four young men - John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr - came together to form the 20th century musical phenomenon known as 'The Beatles'. The band stormed Europe in 1963 and, in 1964, they conquered America. Their groundbreaking world tours changed global youth culture forever and, arguably, invented mass entertainment as we know it today. All the while, the group were composing and recording a series of extraordinarily successful singles and albums. However, the relentless pressure of such unprecedented fame (which in 1966 became uncontrollable turmoil) led to the decision to stop touring. In the ensuing years The Beatles were then free to focus on a series of albums that changed the face of recorded music. Master storyteller and Oscar winner, Ron Howard, explores this incredible journey in his own unique way: How did The Beatles do this? How did they cope with all the fame and pressure? How did they not only survive, but go on to revolutionise popular music? With original interviews, footage, staggering live performances, and the intimate study of character that Ron Howard is known for, he puts us right inside this extraordinary adventure, answering the question everyone always wants to know: What was it like to be there?"},

"longDescription":"Meet the Beatles! Just one month after they exploded onto the U.S. scene with their Ed Sullivan Show appearance, John, Paul, George, and Ringo began working on a project that would bring their revolutionary talent to the big screen. A Hard Day’s Night, in which the bandmates play wily, exuberant versions of themselves, captured the astonishing moment when they officially became the singular, irreverent idols of their generation and changed music forever. Directed with raucous, anything-goes verve by Richard Lester and featuring a slew of iconic pop anthems, including the title track, “Can’t Buy Me Love,” “I Should Have Known Better,” and “If I Fell,” A Hard Day’s Night, which reconceived the movie musical and exerted an incalculable influence on the music video, is one of the most deliriously entertaining movies of all time. New 4K digital restoration, approved by director Richard Lester, and 5.1 surround mix supervised by sound producers Giles Martin and Sam Okell at Abbey Road Studios."},
